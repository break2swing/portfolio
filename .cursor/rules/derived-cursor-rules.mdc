## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

This section covers guidelines for project documentation, especially regarding the `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files.

### Updating `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`

The `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files must be kept up-to-date to reflect the current state of the codebase. The update process involves:

1.  **Reading Existing Files:** Always start by reading the current versions of `@CLAUDE.md` and `@AGENTS.md`.
2.  **Project Analysis:** Analyze the project structure, configuration, key components, contexts, services, and library configurations. Key files to inspect include:
    *   `package.json`
    *   `tsconfig.json`
    *   `next.config.js`
    *   `tailwind.config.ts`
    *   `app/layout.tsx`
    *   `app/*/page.tsx`
    *   `components/AppLayout.tsx`
    *   `contexts/*.tsx`
    *   `services/*.tsx`
    *   `components/Sidebar.tsx`
    *   `components/Topbar.tsx`
    *   `lib/*.ts`
3.  **Change Identification:** Compare the current project state with the documentation in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to identify discrepancies. Look for:
    *   New contexts or services.
    *   New routes or pages.
    *   New important dependencies.
    *   Changes in architecture.
    *   New patterns or conventions.
    *   Modifications in provider structure.
4.  **`CLAUDE.md` Content:**
    *   **Must Include:**
        *   Project overview.
        *   Development commands.
        *   High-level architecture (requiring the reading of multiple files).
        *   Route structure.
        *   Layout system.
        *   Theme and context systems.
        *   Backend integration (e.g., Supabase).
        *   Component library.
        *   Development patterns.
    *   **Must Not Include:**
        *   Obvious instructions.
        *   Generic development practices.
        *   Easily discoverable information.
5.  **`AGENTS.md` Content:**
    *   **Must Include:**
        *   Naming conventions.
        *   File structure (templates).
        *   Import order.
        *   Patterns to follow (Client vs Server, state management, error handling).
        *   Specific workflows (adding pages, service, component).
        *   Styling guidelines.
        *   Project-specific points of attention.
        *   Language conventions.
    *   **Template Format:** Always provide concrete code examples showing the expected file structure.
6.  **Validation:** Ensure consistency between the two files, up-to-date information, correct code examples, accurate file paths, and a provider hierarchy in `app/layout.tsx` that matches the actual code. Also ensure new services/contexts are documented.
7. **Process:**
    * List the identified changes as bullet points.
    * Update `CLAUDE.md` with the necessary modifications.
    * Update `AGENTS.md` with the necessary modifications.
    * Summarize the changes made in each file.
8. **Important Instructions:**
    * Be exhaustive in the analysis.
    * Verify ALL contexts in `contexts/`.
    * Verify ALL services in `services/`.
    * List all current routes.
    * Verify the actual structure of providers in `app/layout.tsx`.
    * Maintain the existing format and structure of the files.
    * Do not invent information - always check the code source.

        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase URL.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key.
        *   (Optional) `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically generated.
        *   (Optional) `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: If using Vercel.
    *   If the main branch is named `master` instead of `main`, update the `.yml` files accordingly.
*   When discussing an idea with AI and asking for a PRD:
    *   For simple projects, use the `example_prd.txt` template.
    *   For complex systems, use the `example_prd_rpg.txt` template (for dependency-aware task graphs). Save the PRD to `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`.
    *   After the PRD is created, parse it to generate initial tasks using: `task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`. Then, analyze the complexity of these tasks with `task-master analyze-complexity --research` and expand the tasks into sub-tasks with `task-master expand --all --research`. Finally, see the next task to do with `task-master next`.
*   When aiming to improve performance, start by analyzing existing plans and tasks related to performance optimization.

## CODING STANDARDS

*   When importing icons from `lucide-react`, and there is a naming conflict with a type or variable, rename the imported icon using `as`. For example: `import { Video as VideoIcon } from 'lucide-react'`.
*   When implementing a social share feature, create `lib/shareUtils.ts` with all sharing utility functions and `components/ShareButton.tsx` with a dropdown menu and share options. Modify `PhotoViewerModal.tsx`, `TextDetailModal.tsx`, and `AudioPlayer.tsx` to include the `ShareButton`.

## DEBUG

*   When debugging errors, especially those reported as generic messages like "Impossible de modifier le morceau," follow these steps:
    1.  **Examine the relevant code:** Start by inspecting the code where the error is occurring, such as the `TrackEditDialog.tsx` or `PhotoEditModal.tsx` components.
    2.  **Implement detailed logging:** Add `console.log` statements to log data and track the flow of execution. Log details such as function arguments, intermediate values, and any relevant state variables.
    3.  **Inspect network requests:** Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses. Check the request payload and response status to identify any issues with the data being sent or received.
    4.  **Improve error handling:** Enhance error handling in the code to provide more specific error messages. Use try-catch blocks to catch errors and log detailed information about the error, including the error message, error code, and any additional details.
    5.  **Check Supabase permissions (RLS):** Verify that the Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly configured to allow the necessary operations.
    6.  **Validate data formats:** Ensure that the data being sent to the database is in the correct format and meets any constraints imposed by the database schema.
    7.  **Test and verify:** After making changes, thoroughly test the code to ensure that the error has been resolved and that no new issues have been introduced.
*   When debugging the "Impossible de modifier le morceau" error specifically:
    1.  **Add detailed logs** to each step of the `TrackEditDialog.tsx` and `PhotoEditDialog.tsx` components, including:
        *   The data being sent for updates.
        *   The stage at which the error occurs (e.g., updating track information, updating tags).
        *   Full error objects, including error type, constructor, and stringified details.
    2.  **Verify `musicTagService.ts` and `photoTagService.ts`** to ensure errors are correctly handled during the deletion of existing tags and insertion of new tags.
    3.  **If the error is related to missing tables** (e.g., `music_tags`):
        *   The code should continue to function, providing a warning that tags could not be updated due to the missing table.
        *   The tag loading process should also be optional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.
    4.  **Ensure proper error messages:** The toast messages should display clear error details, including message, code, status code, hint, and details.
* When a table is missing, the code must continue to function, providing a warning that tags could not be updated due to the missing table. The tag loading process should also be optional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.
* When displaying tags on public pages, ensure that each page displays only the tags that are actually used for its content type:
    * Page Photos: only tags from the `photo_tags` table.
    * Page Music: only tags from the `music_tags` table.
    * Page Videos: only tags from the `video_tags` table.
    * Page Texts: only tags from the `text_tags` table.
* When implementing code splitting with `next/dynamic`, always include a `<Skeleton>` component as the `loading` fallback, and set `ssr: false`.
* With `output: 'export'`, Next.js does not allow the use of `headers()` in `next.config.js`. For a static export, headers must be configured at the web server or hosting platform level. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for instructions.
* When encountering `ReferenceError: sessionStorage is not defined`, especially during server-side rendering (SSR), ensure that `sessionStorage` is only accessed in a client-side context. Use a conditional check (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`) before accessing `window.sessionStorage`. If server-side functionality is required, provide a fallback or alternative storage mechanism.
* When implementing enhanced audio player features, follow these guidelines:
    *   **State Management:** Utilize `localStorage` via `lib/audioPlayerStorage.ts` to persist and restore player state (shuffle, repeat, volume, current time). Expire saved data after 30 days.
    *   **Shuffle Mode:** Implement shuffle using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
    *   **Repeat Mode:** Support 'none', 'one', and 'all' repeat modes.
    *   **Progress Bar Preview:** Display a preview with formatted time on the progress bar during hover.
    *   **Keyboard Controls:** Implement keyboard controls for play/pause (Space), skip forward/backward (ArrowLeft/ArrowRight), volume control (ArrowUp/ArrowDown), and track navigation (Shift + ArrowLeft/ArrowRight).
    *   **Track List Styling:** Indicate the currently playing track in `TrackList.tsx` with visual cues (icon, background color).
    *   **Tooltips:** Use tooltips to explain the functionality of shuffle and repeat buttons.
* When the `LinkedinIcon` component is not defined, it means that the icon was removed during code cleanup. It must be added back by including the relevant SVG code in the `components/ShareButton.tsx` file.
* When using `window.location.origin` in components like `PhotoViewerModal`, `TextDetailModal`, and `AudioPlayer`, ensure to use a conditional check (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`) to prevent errors during server-side rendering or dynamic loading. Example:
    ````
    url={`${typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : ''}/photos#photo-${currentPhoto.id}`}
    ````
* When using `navigator` or `document` APIs (e.g., in `copyToClipboard` function), ensure to use conditional checks to prevent errors during server-side rendering or dynamic loading. Example:
    ````
    if (typeof window === 'undefined' || typeof navigator === 'undefined' || typeof document === 'undefined') {
        return false;
    }
    ````
* **Database Migrations:** If a "Could not find the table" error occurs, it indicates that the database migration has not been run. To resolve this, execute the SQL migration script in your Supabase project using the SQL Editor. The script is located at `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_playlists_system.sql`. After running the migration, verify that the tables are created in the Table Editor.
* When adding social share capabilities, ensure that the correct `ShareContentType` is passed when generating share URLs.
* When the audio player is not producing sound:
    * Ensure that the audio is only played once it is loaded
    * Implement error handling around the audio play function
    * Double check the  `useEffect` hook that manages track changes is properly configured and that it is listening for the correct state changes
* The `AudioPlayer` component should also:
    * Listen for changes to `initialTrackIndex` and update the `currentTrackIndex` state accordingly.
    * Set `isPlaying` to `true` when a new track is loaded, but do so only after the audio has been loaded via `handleCanPlay`.
* To resolve issues with the track list not responding to the "Play" icon, ensure that :
    * The `useEffect` hook that handles playback is listening for both `isPlaying` and `currentTrackIndex`.
    * The audio element's `readyState` is checked before attempting to play to prevent playing before the audio loads.
    * An error handler is implemented for the `audio.play()` call to catch and log any playback errors.
* When implementing a social share feature and Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin icons are not available in `lucide-react`, use the following simple SVG components:
 ```javascript
 // Simple SVG icons for social networks
 const TwitterIcon = ({ className }: { className?: string }) => (
  <X className={className} />
 );
